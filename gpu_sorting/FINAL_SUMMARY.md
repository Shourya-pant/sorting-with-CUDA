## Implementation Details

### Algorithm: Bitonic Sort

We chose the bitonic sort algorithm for its excellent parallelization properties. It's particularly well-suited for GPU implementation because:

1. It has predictable memory access patterns
2. It can be efficiently implemented using parallel comparisons and swaps
3. It performs well on data sizes that are powers of 2
4. It maps well to the GPU's thread and block architecture

### Key Components

The implementation consists of several key components:

1. **Host Code (main.cpp)**: Handles data generation, memory allocation, and result verification
2. **CUDA Kernel (sort.cu)**: Implements the parallel bitonic sort algorithm on the GPU
3. **CPU Implementation (sort_cpu_only.cpp)**: Provides a CPU-only implementation for comparison

## Setup and Compilation Requirements

To build and run this project, you'll need:

1. **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support
2. **CUDA Toolkit** (10.0 or higher) - [Download CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
3. **Visual Studio** with C++ development tools - [Download Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
   - Install the "Desktop development with C++" workload

See `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed installation instructions.

## Running the Project

After installing the required tools:

1. Open the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `build.bat` to compile the CUDA implementation
4. Run `build\gpu_sorting.exe` to execute the program

## Expected Results

When running with a large array (e.g., 2²⁰ elements), you should observe:

1. The GPU sorting being significantly faster than CPU sorting (10-40x speedup)
2. Correct sorting results for both implementations
3. Performance scaling with array size (larger arrays = greater speedup)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you have a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU
2. Verify CUDA Toolkit is properly installed (`nvcc --version`)
3. Make sure Visual Studio with C++ tools is installed
4. Use the Developer Command Prompt to ensure correct environment variables

See `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for more detailed troubleshooting steps.

## Further Development

This implementation can be extended in several ways:

1. **Optimization**: Improve memory coalescing and bank conflict avoidance
2. **Shared Memory**: Implement a version using GPU shared memory for better performance
3. **Other Algorithms**: Implement and compare other parallel sorting algorithms (radix sort, merge sort)
4. **Multi-GPU Support**: Extend to use multiple GPUs for even larger datasets
5. **Generic Types**: Make the implementation work with various data types

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the powerful performance benefits of GPU computing for parallelizable algorithms like sorting. The implementation showcases core CUDA concepts and provides a foundation for further exploration of GPU-accelerated computing.
